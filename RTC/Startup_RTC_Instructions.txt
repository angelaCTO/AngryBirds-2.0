/* 
* Instructions on how to set up the Beaglebone Black so it 
* grabs the time from an attached RTC on startup and sets it as the system
* time.
*/

- Change permissions using visudo to allow root access with NO PASSWORD
- Create a bash file in /bin called “clock_init”
- Copy this into the bash file:

    #! /bin/bash
    
    sudo su
    echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device
    hwclock -s -f /dev/rtc1
    hwclock -w

- Use “crontab -e” in order to alter the crontab file
- Append this code at the end of crontab:
	
    @reboot cd /path/to/directory/of/clock_init/ && sudo ./clock_init

- Restart your BBB and type “date” in order to check the system’s date and time
